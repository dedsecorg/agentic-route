## Operational Guidance

The `route`, `bypass`, and `enforce` commands can modify local routing or firewall state. Run them only on systems you administer and review configuration changes before applying them.

## Known Vulnerabilities

None currently tracked. Check [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/dedsecorg/agentic-route/security/advisories) for updates.

## Scope

This policy covers the agentic-route daemon, CLI, and reconciliation engine. It does not cover upstream dependencies (iproute2, bash, kernel Netlink) — report those to their respective maintainers.
